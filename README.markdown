== Indigio / Ingidio Desktop Application

Contained in the IndigioApp is the C# code for the first incarnation
of the Indigio appplication for the Windows 7 desktop game recorder.

Like a ruby-rails application, this one is done in the traditional
MVC style. Because of the desktop nature of this system, a good
windows machine with .NET and traditional WINAPIs are required to
actually run this.
